Developing a stock market analyst/trader using data science

Stock trading is considered as one of the most efficient ways of investing in today’s world. Numerous studies have shown that, over long periods of time, stocks generate investment returns that are superior to those from every other asset class.
But it is often seen that many potential traders or amateur investors don’t have the time or the much-needed expertise when it comes to analyzing the stock market. Here is where my idea for an AI Stock Analyst comes into the picture. The program uses vast amounts of data to predict how a particular stock will grow or fall. This simplifies the trading process while minimizing the risk.
While conceptualising my project, my biggest question was where or from whom will I get my data? I thought that why not use the biggest ever source of data right in front of me – the internet. Even collecting data from an ever-changing source like the stock exchange market can become a task. So, I had to use various other python modules to setup a link between the internet source and my programme.
All in all, this project will encourage people to experiment different strategies while trading stocks and also help amateur traders to make better decisions when it comes to the buying and selling of stocks.

The primary aim of this project is to create a basic AI stock analyst that successfully analyses the stock market in various ways.
If the thought of investing in the stock market scares you, you are not alone. The reality is that investing in the stock market carries risk. But when approached in a disciplined manner, it is one of the most efficient ways to build up one's net worth!
Stock markets are very sensitive to change. For example: they are affected by the news about business environment, change of governments, etc. So, most amateur traders find it difficult to spend large number of hours required for keeping tab on latest updates in the market. Using my project, traders can rely on the program to do this part of the job for them.

The following additions can be made in the future to improve the program
The program can be linked to various stock exchanges all over the world.
The program can be modified to allow the actual buying and selling of stocks.
The program can also be made incorporate more trading strategies.

Thus the program can be made more intelligent by taking this information into consideration.
